# Image-Processing-Service

This project aims to be a free clone of the Cloudinary website, it uses `Node.js` for the handling requests and `Python` for processing images.

1. Storage Organization:
Cloud Storage Buckets:
- originals/           (original uploaded images)
- transformed/         (processed versions)

2. Redis Cache Structure:
CopyKeys:
- image:{id}:{transformations} -> public_url
- image:{id}:metadata -> {width, height, format, ...}
